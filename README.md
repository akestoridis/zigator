## Disclaimer

Zigator is a software tool that analyzes the security of Zigbee networks, which is made available for benign research purposes only.
The users of this tool are responsible for making sure that they are compliant with their local laws and that they have proper permission from the affected network owners.


## Installation

You can install Zigator using pip for Python 3 as follows:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/akestoridis/zigator.git
$ cd zigator/
$ pip3 install .
```

The following command should display the version of Zigator that you installed:
```
$ zigator -v
```

If you get an error message that the `zigator` command was not found, make sure that your system's PATH environment variable includes the directory of the installed executable. For example, if it was installed in `~/.local/bin`, add the following line at the end of your `~/.bashrc` file:
```
export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
```

After reloading your `~/.bashrc` file, you should be able to find the `zigator` command.


## Features

Zigator enables its users to do the following:

* Derive preconfigured Trust Center link keys from install codes
* Decrypt and verify Zigbee packets
* Encrypt and authenticate Zigbee packets
* Parse almost all the header fields of Zigbee packets up to the APS layer
* Infer information from captured Zigbee packets
* Produce statistics from a database of Zigbee packets
* Visualize data from a database of Zigbee packets
* Train decision tree classifiers from a database of Zigbee packets
* Inject forged packets over UDP
* Launch selective jamming and spoofing attacks with an ATUSB


## Getting Started

If you cannot capture your own Zigbee packets, you may use the pcap files of the [CRAWDAD dataset cmu/zigbeeâ€‘smarthome](https://doi.org/10.15783/c7-nvc6-4q28) for your analysis.
After submitting the [CRAWDAD registration form](https://crawdad.org/registration-form.html), you will receive a username that will allow you to download the following zip files:

* https://crawdad.org/download/cmu/zigbee-smarthome/sth3-room.zip
* https://crawdad.org/download/cmu/zigbee-smarthome/sth2-room.zip
* https://crawdad.org/download/cmu/zigbee-smarthome/sth3-duos.zip
* https://crawdad.org/download/cmu/zigbee-smarthome/sth2-duos.zip
* https://crawdad.org/download/cmu/zigbee-smarthome/sth3-house.zip
* https://crawdad.org/download/cmu/zigbee-smarthome/sth2-house.zip
* https://crawdad.org/download/cmu/zigbee-smarthome/sth3-trios.zip
* https://crawdad.org/download/cmu/zigbee-smarthome/sth2-trios.zip

Each of these zip files contains a pcap file of captured Zigbee packets and a text file that provides a description of the experimental setup and the encryption keys that were used. You can then view a synopsis of all the commands that Zigator supports in order to analyze them:
```
$ zigator -h
```
